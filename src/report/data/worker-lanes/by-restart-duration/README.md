# Worker-lanes algorithm

Distributes Playwright test timings into visual lanes for the timeline chart.

## Why this algorithm is needed

By default Playwright runs test files in parallel across the configured worker pool, but keeps tests within each file sequential on a single worker — so files map 1-to-1 to lanes. But there are settings that change this behavior:

- Root config `fullyParallel: true` makes every test run independently, so each test gets its own worker slot.
- Root config `workers: N` limits the total number of concurrent workers across all projects.
- Per-project `workers` / `fullyParallel` override the global defaults for that project only.
- `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' })` inside a file or describe block makes that subset run in parallel, even when the rest of the suite does not.

## Why not just mapping `parallelIndex → lane`

- When a project has fewer workers than the global maximum, its tests reuse low `parallelIndex` values that are also used by other projects, causing apparent collisions.
- Near the end of a run, remaining active workers shift down to fill lower `parallelIndex` slots, making the same index mean different physical workers at different points in time.

This algorithm therefore derives the actual lane assignment purely from observed timing data (`workerIndex`, `parallelIndex`, `startTime`, `duration`), with no dependency on any Playwright config flags.

## Phase 1 — Parallel-worker analysis (`analyze-parallel-workers.ts`)

Each test contributes a `start` and `end` timing marker. Markers are sorted by time (end-before-start on ties, to avoid counting boundary moments as concurrent) and walked with a running `Set<parallelIndex>`. This yields:

- `maxParallelWorkers` — global peak concurrency; hard cap for Phase 2.
- `maxParallelWorkersPerProject` — per-project peak; used for lane consolidation.
- `lastTestInWorker` — last `TestTimings` per `workerIndex`; a lane is free for reuse only when its last test is in this set.
- `lanePool` — N empty `WorkerLane` slots pre-created upfront.

## Phase 2 — Backtracking assignment (`assign-test.ts`)

Tests are processed in `startTime` order. For each test:

**Step A — Same `workerIndex`**
If any lane's last test shares the test's `workerIndex`, the test comes from the same Playwright worker process. Append it to that lane with no branching.

**Step B — New `workerIndex`, candidates exist**
Collect eligible lanes (worker done + idle + same-project passed exclusion + consolidation rule below).

- 1 candidate → assign directly.
- 2+ candidates → try each as a separate branch; collect all non-null results; pick the best-ranked survivor (see Branch scoring below).

**Step C — New `workerIndex`, no candidates**
The test needs a fresh slot. If the number of currently active lanes already equals `maxParallelWorkers`, this branch would exceed the observed physical concurrency peak — discard it (`return null`). Otherwise claim the next empty lane from the pool.

### Lane consolidation rule (Step B)

Count `projectLanesUsed` = distinct lanes already containing tests from this project. If `projectLanesUsed >= maxParallelWorkersPerProject[project]`, restrict candidates to those existing project lanes. This prevents a project with `workers: 1` (where every failing test bumps `workerIndex`) from spreading across lanes — all must funnel into the one established project lane.

### Same-project passed exclusion (Step B)

If a candidate lane's last test belongs to the same project and finished with status `passed`, exclude that lane. A passing test should not imply a worker restart inside the same project, so assigning the next same-project test to that lane would create an artificial restart.

## Branch scoring (`scoring.ts`)

When multiple branches survive, each branch gets a restart-duration variability value equal to the sum of per-project population variance of same-project worker-restart gaps (idle time between consecutive same-project tests in a lane that have different `workerIndex` values). Lower variability means more evenly spaced restarts and usually a more correct lane layout. Cross-project transitions are excluded because another project can have its own worker limit, so large gaps there are expected and are not useful for lane selection.

If multiple branches have the same restart-duration variability, tie-breaking works like this:

- Prefer a branch where every test file stays within a single lane for its project (`splitFilesCount === 0`). This matches non-fully-parallel runs where files should not hop between lanes.
- Otherwise treat the run as effectively fully parallel and pick the branch with the smallest total same-project restart duration.
